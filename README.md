## Deployment the old fashioned way 

If the magic 'deploy' button (should be above) doesn't work you can try deploying it from command line, this way. 



```
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/utunga/ok-barometer.git
Cloning into 'ok-barometer'...
```

Spin up a postgres db and create/edit the .env file in prisma folder to set the following properties..

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@c2-1-22-33-129.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/gcedfg"

DATABASE_MIGRATE_URL="postgres://user:pass@ec2-1-22-33-129.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/abcdef"
```


Deploy using vercel

```
‚ùØ cd ok-barometer
‚ùØ npm i -g vercel@24.2.5-canary.2
‚ùØ vercel
Vercel CLI 24.2.5-canary.2 ‚Äî https://vercel.com/feedback
